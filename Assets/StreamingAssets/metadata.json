It completes a series of eleven statues of all the Brandenburg electors from the house of Hohenzollern that had been commissioned by Frederick’s predecessor and were displayed in the Alabaster Hall of the Berlin Palace together with the statues of four emperors. The statues were created in Amsterdam, with a few exceptions that may hail from Berlin. They were displayed in the Alabaster Hall until 1728 and subsequently moved to the White Hall of the Berlin Palace, where they remained even after the hall was remodelled under King Frederick William IV in 1844. A further redesign of the hall was undertaken in 1892 by Kaiser Wilhelm II, during which the statues were removed and installed separately in two staircases and two apartments in the Berlin Palace. The statues of Electors Joachim Frederick and George William have been missing since 1945. All the statues except those of Electors Frederick I and Frederick II, which were installed in the Upper Vestibule, were displayed in the Marble Hall of the New Palace in Potsdam from 1953 onwards.",

On 23 March 1993, a joint committee of the Federal Government and the Berlin Senate resolved to tear down the building. Wolfgang Mattheuer reported that he attempted to buy back his painting in response to a communiqué sent out to all the participating artists, but that his request was denied. In accordance with Section 21 of the Unification Treaty, the paintings of the Palast-Galerie became the property of the Federal Republic of Germany and have been stored in a depot of the Deutsches Historisches Museum since 1995. In February 1996, the museum presented the ensemble in a much publicized exhibition titled Dürfen Kommunisten träumen? Bilder aus dem Palast der Republik (“Are communists allowed to dream? Pictures from the Palace of the Republic”) which had a short run in the south wing of the Zeughaus. Eight paintings from the palace gallery were shown in Weimar in the 1999 exhibition Offiziell/Inoffiziell (“Official/Unofficial”). Since then, individual paintings from this group of works have only occasionally been featured in exhibitions. All the paintings were meticulously cleaned and restored during the preparations for a comprehensive exhibition of all the works in the Museum Barberini in Potsdam in 2017/2018.",

In the late 1930s, the Reich government confiscated the site and buildings and forced Georg Wertheim to relinquish ownership. In 1945, the Soviet occupying forces once again confiscated the Wertheim property, which was divided in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built through Berlin-Mitte. In the course of the reunification of Germany, most of the formerly Jewish-owned properties in East Berlin were transferred into the ownership of the State of Berlin or the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1991, the Berlin Senate sold the property on Potsdamer Platz to the department store chain Hertie, which had acquired Wertheim in the mid-1980s, for the symbolic price of one Deutschmark. Hertie was in turn acquired by Karstadt-Quelle in 1994, which sold the property to Otto Beisheim, the founder of Metro, for 145 million euros in 2000./n In 2001, a legal battle for ownership of the site ensued between the heirs of the Wertheim family and Karstadt-Quelle. After months of secret talks between CEO Middelhoff and Jewish Claims Conference president Haller, the dispute was settled out of court in 2007 through the mediation of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Karstadt-Quelle paid 88 million euros to the Wertheim heirs./n The safe door came into focus when Dimitri Hegemann and his partners leased the premises at Leipziger Straße 126–128 between 1990 and 2005 and opened and ran a techno club in the old strongroot. According to an agreement with the then lessor, Bauwert Development Delta GmbH, the lessee had the right to remove the door and other fixtures when the property was scheduled to be demolished. The door and lock boxes from the Tresor-Club were transferred to the new premises of the club in Köpenicker Straße, which opened in 2007./n The door is on loan to the Stadtmuseum Berlin from Dimitri Hegemann, the owner of the Tresor-Club.",
